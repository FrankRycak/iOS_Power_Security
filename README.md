# iOS_Power_Security

Repo for an iOS app I made. It's done with basic knowledge I have in Swift. Previously I lived in Beijing, and the electricity is the most reliable. I was always paranoid that the power would go out at night while my phone was plugged in. And my phone would die, resulting in my alarm not going off and me not waking up for work. That lead to some shitty nights of sleep.

So what I did was just made a simple app, that once it was plugged in to power and "armed" if it ever lost that power, an annoying alarm would go off and let me know to find another source, to wake me up. 

Enjoy!
